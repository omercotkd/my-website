  steps: [
    "I first discovered coding in high school by learning C in a electronics course, but life took me in other directions for a while.",
    "During the corona lockdown, I got bored and decided to learn new skills, so I started coding again with C, learning about networking and Python.",
    "After a while a friend of my dad asked me if I know how to code, and told me if I learn React he can offer me a job. So I dove into React and web development.",
    "He kept his word and offered me a half-time job at SaitLabs, and after a month I was hired full-time.",
  ],
